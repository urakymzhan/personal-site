## Key Terms In Crypto World

**DeFi**

DeFi (or “decentralized finance”) is an umbrella term for financial services on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum. With DeFi, you can do most of the things that banks support — earn interest, borrow, lend, buy insurance, trade derivatives, trade assets, and more — but it’s faster and doesn’t require paperwork or a third party. As with crypto generally, DeFi is global, peer-to-peer (meaning directly between two people, not routed through a centralized system), pseudonymous, and open to all.

**Ethereum**

A public blockchain network and decentralized software platform upon which developers build and run applications. As it is a proper noun, it should always be capitalized.

**Ether (ETH)**

Ether is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain network. Ether—also referred to as ETH.

**Decentralization**

The transfer of authority and responsibility from a centralized organization, government, or party to a distributed network.

**Decentralized exchange**

A decentralized exchange is a platform for exchanging cryptocurrencies based on functionality programmed on the blockchain (i.e., in smart contracts). The trading is peer-to-peer, or between pools of liquidity. This is in contrast with a centralized exchange, which is more akin to a bank or investment firm that specializes in cryptocurrencies. There are important technical and regulatory differences between the two which are constantly evolving.

**Digital asset**

A digital commodity that is scarce, electronically transferable, and intangible with a market value.

**NFT**

When discussing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), “fungibility” refers to an object’s ability to be exchanged for another. For example, an individual dollar is considered fungible as we can trade dollars with one another. Artwork is usually deemed non-fungible as paintings, sculptures, or masterpieces are likely to be unequal in quality or value. A non-fungible token is a type of token that is a unique digital asset and has no equal token. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like ether that are fungible in nature.

**Blockchain**

A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography. They are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network for use as a publicly distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a protocol to communicate and validate new blocks. The blockchain was popularized by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, based on work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.

**Crypto Gaming**

Instead of buying a game outright or funneling money into a free-to-play title, the game would actually pay you to play it, with built-in incentives to reward your time and often a small financial stake in the company that makes it.

**Encrypted vs Unencrypted keys**

As discussed elsewhere, public and private crypographic key pairs are one of the technologies that underpins cryptocurrencies and “crypto” tech in general. In MetaMask, an unencrypted private key is 64 characters long, and it is used to unlock or restore wallets. An encrypted key is also 64 letters long and is a regular private key that has gone through the process of encryption.

**Wallet**

A designated storage location for digital assets (cryptocurrency) that has an address for sending and receiving funds. The wallet can be online, offline, or on a physical device

**Web3**

Web3, or Web 3.0, are terms used synonymously with “the decentralized web” and are often used to refer, broadly, to the blockchain and decentralized technology ecosystems as a whole.

**Market cap**

Short for Market Capitalization, this term refers to the total value held in a particular industry, market, company, or asset. For a publicly traded company, the market cap is the total dollar market value of a company’s outstanding shares. For Bitcoin or Ethereum, the total market cap is a reflection of the current existing supply times the market price.

**Private key**

A private key is an alphanumeric string of data that, in MetaMask, corresponds to a single specific account in a wallet. Private keys can be thought of as a password that enables an individual to access their crypto account. Never reveal your private key to anyone, as whoever controls the private key controls the account funds. If you lose your private key, then you lose access to that account.

**Mining**

The process by which blocks or transactions are verified and added to a blockchain using a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism.

**token**

A token represents an asset built on an existing blockchain. There are many types; see also ‘ERC-20’ and ‘ERC-721’ entries

**Transaction fee**

A small fee imposed on some transactions sent across a blockchain network. The transaction fee is awarded to the miner that successfully hashes the block containing the relevant transaction.

## Platforms/Apps to exchange crypto

This might depend on your location/region/country.
Fees also might change over time.

- **Coinbase** (0.5% - 4.5%. Flat 2.49% fee) (Use Coinbase Pro if you need to get rid of fees)
- **Crypto.com** (0%-2.99%)
- **Gemini** (0.5% - 3.99%)
- **Etoro** (0.75% to 2.9%)
- **BlockFi** ($0)
- **Binance.US** (0.1%-5%)
- **Kraken** (0.9%-2%)

**MetaMask**

MetaMask, either in its mobile app form on iOS and Android, or in its browser extension form, is a tool to access and interact with blockchains and the decentralized web. Its functions include that of a wallet, a dapp permissions manager, and token swap platform.

### Online Brokers

Several brokers offer cryptocurrency trading in addition to stocks, funds and other asset classes

**Robinhood** (free)

First rule of crypto. not your keys, not your coins.
You don't actually own crypto with robinhood. In coinbase you can withdraw your crypto to a wallet that you own the keys to. And if you wanna save money on fees use coinbase pro.

**Webull** (free)

### Cash and payment apps

A number of cash and peer-to-peer payment apps now allow users to buy and sell bitcoin. On balance, these apps are more limited in what they offer than the exchanges and brokers above.
**Ex: Cash App, Venmo, PayPal**
