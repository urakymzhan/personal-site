# Just thougths in Quarantine

\*\* _these are my personal thoughts and doesn't belong to any group or ideology_

When all these pandemic started couple month back i wasn't taking it serious. Sometimes even today
i am having hard time believeing that there are people around the world dying from the virus.

Still can not believe that all of us one day will diseppear from this universe.
This thought kept me thinking why we fighting for everyday.

I am not claiming anyone to be lazy and do nothing but think about after death.
In fact my religion [calls for activity and action and fights against laziness and procrastination.](https://archive.islamonline.net/18315)

From here next questions arise: What is balance?

What is the thing that makes people happy here and after.

Working hard everyday destroying your health thus making good money?

Or dedicate yourself to God and less worry about financial situation ?

What really brings happinees to people.

I come to realization that there are many small things that makes people happy. But all of them are for short period of time.

I come to believe this life is indeed a test. We all come and go.
The core thing is not money, property or anything material.
Its people.
Its all about how do you interact with them in your daily life.
How you treat them.

Pandemic thought me that there is thin line bewteen life and death.
So its important to be nice to people and help them while you have a time.
I know this sounds like a philosophical thougths but reality is the same.

All i ask is to be patient and be nice to each other in this hard period of time.
The rest will come and go.

### Lastly in quarantine:

1. Understood how selfish i am at times. Learned to be nice to people around me.
2. I found projects that i love and built them. I never did much in my entire life
3. Learnt working out at home is not enjoyable than at the gym.
4. Learnt how multitasking was killing me. Now trying to focus each task at a time.
5. Sometimes you don't have to run. Slowing pace is also one step forward.
6. No matter what, people still going to judge you.
7. There are people who try to take advantage of this pandemic situation.
8. People don't listen but code listens.
